# Hanwsallak (هنوصلك)
📌 About the Project

Hanwsallak is a web application that connects people who want to send packages with travelers or drivers going in the same direction.
This creates a faster and cheaper alternative to traditional shipping companies.

❓ The Problem

Shipping companies usually charge high fees and take a long time to deliver packages.
If someone needs urgent delivery at a lower cost, there are very limited options.

💡 The Solution

Hanwsallak solves this by letting:

Senders post their shipment details (type, weight, pickup, drop-off, and price offer).

Travelers/Drivers register on the platform, verify their identity, and accept or negotiate offers.
This way, both sides benefit — senders get fast & affordable delivery, and travelers earn money while on their trip.

🔑 Key Features

User registration (senders & drivers) with identity verification.

Post shipment requests with package details, weight, pickup & drop-off locations, and offered price.

Travelers can accept or negotiate shipment offers.

Direct communication between senders and travelers for final details.
